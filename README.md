## AI Programming with Python Project (pytorch)

# Image Classifier Notebook:
1. Import data using 'torchvision.ImageFolder'.
2. Create model using a pretrained CNN and replace its classifer by a new one, which fits the input data.
3. Train the model and validate its accuracy during training with validate-dataset.
4. Test model with test-dataset.
5. Save model.
6. Load model.
7. Preprocess input image to fit the model
8. Predict class.
